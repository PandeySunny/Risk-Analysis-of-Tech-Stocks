# 📊 Risk Analysis of Tech Stocks using Python

A comprehensive financial data analytics project focused on evaluating the **risk-return profiles** of leading tech companies. This analysis uses real stock market data to demonstrate key concepts in **portfolio risk**, **volatility**, and **investment decision-making** through Python and statistical modeling.

> ✅ Designed for inclusion in data analyst and finance internship applications (Goldman Sachs Summer Analyst Program 2025 ready)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the historical performance and financial risk of major tech stocks including:
- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Google (GOOGL)
- Meta (META)

The goal is to simulate an analyst’s workflow for assessing risk exposure and identifying diversification opportunities using data-driven techniques.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Analyze **daily and cumulative returns** of tech stocks
- Visualize **volatility trends** and **moving averages**
- Measure **risk using standard deviation and Sharpe Ratio**
- Calculate **covariance and correlation** between asset returns
- Perform **comparative risk assessment** for investment strategy
